## Description
This game is called AntiPong! 

It's likely been made several other times in various formats. Traditionally, in Pong you move your rectangle up and down and try to deflect a ball back towards the computer. In "Anti" Pong, the goal is to not let the balls hit you. You could also call it boring Galaga, without a gun.

## Getting Started
Prior to cloning the repository you'll need Java 8 and the JDK installed on your machine to run, along with a Java IDE (I used Netbeans and SceneBuilder).

## Installing
I used the "Clean + Build" command in Netbeans, but alternatively you could navigate to `AntiPong/src/antipong` and run `javac AntiPong.java` then `java AntiPong`.

## Running the Application
Select "Run" in Netbeans or run `java AntiPong` from the appropriate directory.
